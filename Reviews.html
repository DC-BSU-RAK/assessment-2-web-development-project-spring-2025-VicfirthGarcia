        <p>If the goal of Persona 3 Reload is to modernize a classic JRPG from the PlayStation 2 era for a new generation of players, then it is undeniably a success. While there may be some legitimate disappointment over the lack of content from Persona 3 FES and Portable, what is here is more than enough to cement Reload’s status as a solid remake that delivers the now definitive version of Persona 3.</p>

        <p>Whether you’re a lifelong Persona fan or a total newcomer, Persona 3: Reload is well worth your time as both a stunning remake and a unique masterpiece.</p>

        <p>Persona 3 is one of my all time favorites and all I wanted was a full remake for it, I got it with the beautiful P5 style as well, re recorded soundtrack and revamped character designs, this remake is a love letter to all the fans of the series.</p>

        <p>Inconsistent graphics and the lack of a female protagonist we had in Portable aside, however, this remains a solid means of enjoying one of the finest RPGs of the past two decades. Its writing is sharper, combat is more satisfying, and it brings this world to life in ways that just weren’t possible several generations ago. Reload might lack its signature rough edge, but those coming around for the first time will find plenty to love.</p>

        <p>As with all Persona games, Persona 3 Reload takes its time, both with its 80 hour story and its slow progression throughout the ingame months. If that's your thing, then there's an amazing game here with an interesting story, fun characters and outstanding music. The combat doesn't always hold up, but it mostly does and it's fun when it works.</p>
